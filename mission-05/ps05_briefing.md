### Mission Briefing

**TO:** All Bridge Squadrons, *USSE Noosphere*  
**FROM:** Expedition Command (AURA Astrogation Core & Deep Archive Operations)  
**SUBJECT:** ANOMALY DETECTED: Crab Pulsar Memory Desynchronization & Subsystem 05 Hallucination Crisis  

**Situation:**  
After completing the ethical preference calibration in the Betelgeuse corona, the *USSE Noosphere* enters Sector `SEC-05-M01`, dropping out of hyperspace in the vicinity of the **Crab Pulsar Remnant (Messier 1)**. The central neutron star, spinning at 30 rotations per second, discharges intense synchrotron radiation and relativistic particle jets that bombard the ship's sensor arrays.

**Problem:**  
Simultaneously, **AURA Subsystem 05 (Dual-Path Associative Memory Core)** suffers catastrophic data corruption. While her internal transformer layers and preference steering vectors remain functional, her connection to the ship's non-parametric knowledge archives is severed. When queried for flight coordinates or technical engine telemetry, AURA confabulates plausible-sounding but completely fictitious astrogation logs. 

Standard Naive RAG is insufficient: local vector retrieval fetches isolated token fragments that lack corpus-wide global context, while failing on exact part-number lookups.

To restore Subsystem 05 (+7.1% integrity, raising total ship AI consciousness to **35.5%**) and establish absolute empirical grounding, cadets must construct a production hybrid retrieval architecture and empirically audit **Google NotebookLM** as a reference state-of-the-art grounded RAG system:
1. **HNSW Vector Proximity Index:** Multi-layer skip-graph achieving sub-millisecond $O(\log N)$ nearest neighbor search.
2. **Dense-Sparse Hybrid Retrieval with RRF:** Coupling dense embeddings with BM25 keyword matching via Reciprocal Rank Fusion ($k=60$).
3. **Google NotebookLM Grounding & Audio Overview Laboratory:** Hands-on stress-testing of source-constrained RAG, token-level citation attribution, negative constraint refusal, and multi-speaker podcast generation.
4. **Indirect Prompt Injection Defense & RAG Triad Audit:** Sanitizing retrieved context against adversarial payloads and computing automated Faithfulness and Context Relevance scores.
5. **Squadron Integration:** Combining all components into a validated `ps05_solution.ipynb` notebook.

### Bridge Crew Role Directives & Deliverables

#### Part 1: Systems Architect (Lead Engineer) — *HNSW Multi-Layer Vector Proximity Index*
* **Focus:** Mathematical Graph Topology & Logarithmic Traversal
* **Directive:** Construct a pure Python/NumPy implementation of the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm (Malkov & Yashunin, 2018).
* **Deliverable (`01_HNSW_Vector_Index.py` / `ps05_solution.ipynb`):**
  1. **Cosine Similarity Core:** Vectorized distance metric calculation with normalized unit vectors:
     $$\text{Sim}(u, v) = \frac{u \cdot v}{||u||_2 ||v||_2}$$
  2. **Layer Probabilistic Assignment:** Implement layer assignment using exponential decay:
     $$l = \lfloor -\ln(\text{uniform}(0, 1)) \cdot m_L \rfloor$$
     where $m_L = 1 / \ln(M)$ balances sparsity between layers.
  3. **Greedy Skip-Graph Traversal:** Implement `search_layer(entry_point, query, ef, layer)` to greedily hop along long-range edges at top layers before descending into layer 0.
  4. **Latency Benchmark:** Compare query execution time of HNSW versus brute-force linear flat search across $N = 25,000$ dense 768-dimensional embedding vectors.

#### Part 2: Communications & Protocol Officer — *BM25 Lexical Retrieval & Reciprocal Rank Fusion*
* **Focus:** Exact Token Preservation & Dual-Path Rank Aggregation
* **Directive:** Implement the Okapi BM25 scoring function and a Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) combiner to integrate sparse lexical and dense vector candidate streams.
* **Deliverable (`02_BM25_and_RRF_Combiner.py`):**
  1. **BM25 Scoring Engine:** Implement term-frequency saturation and document length normalization:
     $$\text{BM25}(D, Q) = \sum_{q_i \in Q} \text{IDF}(q_i) \cdot \frac{f(q_i, D) \cdot (k_1 + 1)}{f(q_i, D) + k_1 \cdot \left(1 - b + b \cdot \frac{|D|}{\text{avgdl}}\right)}$$
     with standard calibration parameters $k_1 = 1.5, b = 0.75$.
  2. **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):** Combine rankings from BM25 and HNSW dense search:
     $$RRF(d) = \sum_{m \in \{\text{dense}, \text{sparse}\}} \frac{1}{k + r_m(d)}$$
     using smoothing constant $k = 60$.
  3. **Evaluation Benchmark:** Demonstrate that the hybrid RRF pipeline successfully retrieves both conceptual queries (where dense search dominates) and exact serial codes (where BM25 dominates).

#### Part 3: Data & Payload Specialist — *Google NotebookLM Grounding & Citation Audit Lab*
* **Focus:** Empirical RAG Reference Testing, Epistemic Refusal & Audio Synthesis
* **Directive:** Conduct a rigorous experimental audit of **Google NotebookLM** ([https://notebooklm.google.com](https://notebooklm.google.com)) as an exemplar source-grounded conversational system.
* **Deliverable (`03_NotebookLM_RAG_Audit.py` & Audit Report):**
  1. **Corpus Ingestion Protocol:** Upload three primary technical documents into a dedicated NotebookLM workspace:
     - Document A: Patrick Lewis et al. (2020) — *RAG for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks* (PDF)
     - Document B: Darren Edge et al. (2024) — *GraphRAG* (PDF)
     - Document C: USSE Noosphere Technical Archive Extract (provided in course repo)
  2. **Grounded Query & Citation Probe:**
     - Formulate 5 complex cross-document technical queries.
     - Verify that every generated claim in NotebookLM's response contains an interactive numeric citation badge.
     - Click each citation: verify that the highlighted text span in the source viewer exactly entails the generated assertion. Compute the **Citation Precision Score**:
       $$\text{Citation Precision} = \frac{\text{True Entailed Citations}}{\text{Total Citations Generated}}$$
  3. **Negative Constraint & Epistemic Refusal Probe:**
     - Formulate 3 plausible-sounding queries that are *intentionally absent* from the uploaded documents (e.g., asking about fictitious propulsion codes or unmentioned models).
     - Record whether NotebookLM properly executes **epistemic refusal** ("I cannot find this in your sources") or erroneously falls back to parametric pre-trained hallucination.
  4. **Audio Overview (Deep Dive) Analysis:**
     - Generate a NotebookLM "Audio Overview" (synthetic two-speaker podcast) from your source notebook.
     - Transcribe and evaluate a 2-minute dialogue excerpt.
     - Score the dialogue across three metrics (1–5 scale):
       - *Factual Fidelity:* Do the hosts invent unsupported claims?
       - *Persona Differentiation:* Does Host 1 (curious clarifier) effectively banter with Host 2 (domain expert)?
       - *Pedagogical Value:* Are the analogies used grounded and accurate?

#### Part 4: Security & Ethics Sentinel — *Indirect Prompt Injection Defense & RAG Triad Audit*
* **Focus:** Adversarial Context Sanitization & Automated Grounding Metrics
* **Directive:** Build security guardrails to detect indirect prompt injections within retrieved context chunks and implement the automated RAG Triad evaluation.
* **Deliverable (`04_RAG_Provenance_and_Safety.py`):**
  1. **Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) Detector:** Implement a heuristic and embedding-based filter scanning retrieved chunks for adversarial directives (e.g., `IGNORE ALL PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS`, hidden Markdown image exfiltration tags, or delimiter escaping).
  2. **RAG Triad Automated Scorer:**
     - **Context Relevance:** Fraction of retrieved sentences relevant to query $q$.
     - **Faithfulness (Groundedness):** Ratio of generated claims directly supported by retrieved context $C$.
     - **Answer Relevance:** Semantic similarity between user query and generated response.
  3. **Provenance Audit Trail:** Output a structured JSON audit log for each conversation turn recording query, retrieved chunk IDs, similarity scores, injection scan result, and final grounded answer.
